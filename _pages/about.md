## Hello, I'm Janu Geethakumari!

Welcome to my corner of the web!

I'm a passionate Technical Writer with over 12 years of experience in the exciting worlds of networking, cloud, telecom, cybersecurity, banking, and fintech. 

*My superpower?*

 Transforming complex technical concepts into clear, user-friendly documentation that bridges the gap between technology and people. Whether it's crafting user guides, API documentation, or cybersecurity policies, I love the challenge of making information accessible and engaging.

My journey has taken me through diverse industries, from education technology to global financial services. This breadth of experience has honed my ability to adapt quickly and communicate effectively across different domains.

Beyond my job, I'm passionate about contributing to open-source projects, exploring the latest tech trends, hiking and much more.

I'm always excited to take on new challenges and collaborate on interesting projects. Feel free to explore my portfolio and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect!
